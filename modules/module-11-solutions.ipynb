    "* Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that revolves around the concept of **objects**, which are **instances** of classes. Python is a multi-paradigm programming language that fully supports OOP. \n",

    "* **Attributes** are data variables that characterize the state of an object. They represent the properties or characteristics of an object. *Methods* are functions that define the behavior of an object. They encapsulate the actions or operations that an object can perform.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Encapsulation:** Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods that operate on that data within a single unit (i.e., a class).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Inheritance:** Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a class (subclass) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (superclass). It promotes code reuse and supports the creation of a hierarchy of classes with specialized behavior.\n",
