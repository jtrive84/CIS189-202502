    "### Exception handling\n",
    "\n",
    "Exception handling in Python is a mechanism for managing errors and other exceptional events that occur during program execution. It allows you to respond to these events in a controlled way, rather than allowing the program to crash. Exception handling is implemented using `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally` blocks. Here’s a breakdown of each:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `try` block: This block contains the code that might raise an exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `except` block: This block catches and handles the exception if one occurs. You can specify the type of exception to catch.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `else` block: This block contains code that runs if no exceptions were raised in the try block.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `finally` block: This block contains code that will run no matter what, whether an exception was raised or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use `try/except` blocks to catch errors and alter the control flow of our program to prevent it from crashing. For example, the following throws an error:"
